# JSW Roll Shop Management

This project was developed during an internship at JSW Steel to assist factory workers in managing the lifecycle of rolls used in steel production. The web application streamlines the tracking and management of rolls, bearings, chocks, stands, wheels, and all related components—from their arrival at the facility to their final disposal.

## Purpose

The main goal of this application is to manage all data associated with rolls and their components, ensuring that every statistic and maintenance record is accurately tracked throughout their lifecycle. It provides an efficient digital solution for factory staff to monitor, update, and report on the status of each item in the roll shop.

## Intended Users

This system is designed for use by factory workers and staff at JSW Steel, enabling them to easily log, update, and retrieve information about shop assets and their operational status.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive tracking of rolls and associated components (bearings, chocks, stands, wheels, etc.)
- Management of roll lifecycle data, from arrival to disposal
- Detailed maintenance and status records for each item
- User-friendly web interface for data entry and reporting
- Automated statistics and summaries for management decision-making

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** Oracle DB
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 templates, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Development Story

This project was built after a thorough analysis of the factory’s workflow, with the aim of digitizing and optimizing the roll management process. It reflects an understanding of both the operational needs of the shop and the best practices in modern web development.
